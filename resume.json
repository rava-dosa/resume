I have always tried to explore as much as possible by pursuing as many possibilities. But this doesn’t mean that quality of work has suffered anywhere or I have not seen depth. I have my own standard for work which I deliver in requisite time, which I promise is high. I have seen depth of topics like Image Processing as well. All mentioned project and few upcoming indicate one thing, I learn and implement really fast but forget fast as well.",
